# CAMIL: Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classificatin

This is an implementation of our model CAMIL (Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification). CAMIL leverages the dependencies among single tiles within a WSI and imposes contextual constraints as prior knowledge to multiple instance learning models. We tested CAMIL on the subtyping of non-small cell lung cancer (NSLC) and lymph node (LN) metastasis, and the results demonstrated its superiority over other state-of-the-art weakly supervised classification algorithms.
